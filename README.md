# Welcome to my simple face recognition app.
In this app you can do face recognition on `.jpg`images by providing the app with a image URL.


This readme will be updated with more info in the upcoming commit to git so stay tuned.
Until then you can play around with this app here: https://facerecognition-front-end-jpb.herokuapp.com

### Note
Since this runs on a free Heroku Dyno the first load of the website might be slow.
Register on the site and then log in with your credentials.

### Limitations
There are some limitations:
* Only detects one face in the provided picture
* Won't check for valid email string, e.g. @gmail.com @outlook.com etc, during registry.
* and some other small stuff.

This was a small side project to play around with both my front-end and back-end skills.
